# Hello-World
I am new to github and therefore working through a tutorial 
I always wanted to learn how to code and now is as good a time a ever :-) The only worry I have is that my love for motorcycles will distract me now that the spring is just around the corner. 
HEck ... I just need to structure and plan things and everything will be OK.
